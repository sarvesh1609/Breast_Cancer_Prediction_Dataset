# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Dataset

The objective of this project is to identify instances where cancer poses a risk of harm, potentially leading to fatal outcomes. The aim is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a given cancer is present or not using the provided dataset.

This project involves seven distinct machine learning algorithms and includes both input data files and executable code written in both Python and R languages.

Comments explaining the logic behind each line of code are provided in both the Python and R files, facilitating a clear understanding of the code.
